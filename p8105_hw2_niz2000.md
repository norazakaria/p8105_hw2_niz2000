# Problem 1

## Read and Clean the Mr. Trash Wheel Sheet

``` r
library(readxl)
Trash_Wheel_Data = read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  select(-x15, -x16, -x17) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls,0)))
```

    ## New names:
    ## * `` -> ...15
    ## * `` -> ...16
    ## * `` -> ...17

The new 2019 version of Mr. Trash Wheel data was used for cleaning and
analyses. All non-data entries and rows without dumpster-specific data
were omited, the number of sports balls was converted to an integer
variable, and reasonable variable names are used, such as “dumpster,”
“month,” “year,” and “sports
balls.”

## Read and Clean Precipitation Data for 2017 and 2018

``` r
Precipitation_2018 = read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 5, skip=1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(Year = 2018)
```

Rows without precipitation data were omitted, and a “year” variable was
added to the 2018 Precipitation
Data.

``` r
Precipitation_2017 = read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 6, skip=1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(Year = 2017)
```

Rows without precipitation data were omitted, and a “year” variable was
added to the 2017 Precipitation
Data.

### Combine Precipitation Datasets

``` r
Precipitation_Data = bind_rows(Precipitation_2018, Precipitation_2017) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    month = as.numeric(month),
    month = month.abb[month])
```

The precipitation datasets were combined, and the month variable was
converted to a character variable.

## About The Data:

After cleaning the datasets, there are 344 observations in the dataset
“Trash\_Wheel\_Data” and there are 24 observations in the dataset
“Precipitation\_Data,” including both 2017 and 2018 data. In order to
perform this analysis, several key variables for both datasets were
identified. In the Trash\_Wheel\_Data set, we are interested in “year,”
“month,” “dumpster,” and “sports\_balls,” as these are the variables
used in this analysis. However, variables such as “weight\_tons,”
“volume\_cubic\_yards,” and “homes\_powered” are also key variables in
analysing this dataset in general, as they pertain to the purpose of
Mr. Trash Wheel in harnessing the power of nature to clean the
Baltimore harbor. In the Precipitation\_Data set, we are interested in
the key variables “month” and “total” which demonstrate the amount of
precipitation in inches, each month. Of note, the variable “month” is
present in both the Trash\_Wheel\_Data and Precipitation\_Data datasets,
as a numeric variable in both datasets. For the available data, the
total amount of precipitation in inches was 70.33 for 2018. The median
number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 was 8.

# Problem 2

### Cleaning the Data in the “pols-month.csv”

``` r
pols = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>%
  mutate(
    month = as.numeric(month),
    month = month.abb[month],
    prez_gop = recode(prez_gop, `1` = "gop", `2` = "gop", `0` = "dem"), 
    president = prez_gop) %>%
  select (-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

There are 822 observations in the cleaned pols dataset. In the pols
dataset the month variable was broken into “year,” “month,” and “day”
integer variables, and the month number was replaced with the name
(i.e. the name Jan is displayed compared to the integer 1). A new
president variable was creaed, and the “day” variable was removed.

### Cleaning the Data in the “snp.csv”

``` r
snp = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year")) %>%
  mutate(
    month = as.numeric(month),
    month = month.abb[month]) %>%
  select (starts_with ("year"), everything(), -day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

There are 787 observations in the cleaned snp dataset. In the snp
dataset, the month number was replaced with the month name, and arranged
according with “year” and “month” as the leading columns.

### Tidy the Unemployment Data

``` r
unemployment =
  read_csv(file = "./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec, 
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment rate") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year = as.character(year))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

The unemployment dataset was switched from “wide” to “long” format
through pivoting, and key variables have the same name to ensure they
take the same values. For example, “year” and “month” are character
variables across the unemployment, pols, and snp datasets. After
cleaning, there are 816 observations in the unemployment dataset.

## Join the Datasets Pols and SNP

``` r
pols_snp = 
  left_join(pols, snp, by = c("year", "month"))
```

There are 822 observations in the joined dataset pols\_snp, joining pols
and snp.

## Join the Datasets Pols\_SNP and Unemployment

``` r
pols_snp_unemployment = 
  left_join(pols_snp, unemployment, by = c("year", "month"))
```

There are 822 observations in the joined dataset
pols\_snp\_unemployment, joining unemployment to the pol\_snp dataset.

## About The Data:

The pols dataset containes data from 1947 to 2015 with 822 observations
and 9 variables, with the key variables being “year,” “month,” and
“president.” The snp dataset contains data ranging from 1950 to 2015,
with 787 observations and 3 variables, “year,” “month,” and “close.” The
unemployment dataset contains data ranging from 1948 to 2015 with 816
observations and 9 variables, “year,” “month,” and “unemployment\_rate.”
The datasets were joined on the key variables “year” and “month” present
in all three datassets, which were cleaned uniformly in order for the
datasets to join successfully.

After joining the datasets pols and snp, the pols\_snp dataset consists
of data from years 1947 to 2015 with 822 observations and 10 variables,
containing key variables such as “year,” “month,” “president,” and
“close.” After joining the unemployment dataset with the new pols\_snp
dataset, there are 822 observations and 11 variables, spanning the same
range of years (1947 to 2015) and containing the same variables as the
pols\_snp dataset, with the addition of unemployment\_rate. The three
datasets were joined on “year” and “month,” with the final dataset
containing the widest variety of variables, and spanning from the
earliest year in any of the three original datasets (1947 from pols) to
the latest in all three (2015).

Explain briefly what each dataset contained, and describe the resulting
dataset (e.g. give the dimension, range of years, and names of key
variables).

# Problem 3

## Tidy the Popular\_Baby\_Names Dataset

``` r
Popular_Baby_Names = 
  read_csv(file = "data/Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(
    first_name = childs_first_name,
    birth_year = year_of_birth) %>%
  mutate(
    first_name = str_to_lower(first_name),
    ethnicity = str_to_lower(ethnicity),
    gender = str_to_lower(gender)) %>%
  mutate(
    ethnicity = if_else(ethnicity == "asian and paci", "asian and pacific islander", ethnicity),
    ethnicity = if_else(ethnicity == "black non hisp", "black non hispanic", ethnicity),
    ethnicity = if_else(ethnicity == "white non hisp", "white non hispanic", ethnicity)) %>%
  distinct()
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   `Year of Birth` = col_double(),
    ##   Gender = col_character(),
    ##   Ethnicity = col_character(),
    ##   `Child's First Name` = col_character(),
    ##   Count = col_double(),
    ##   Rank = col_double()
    ## )

There are 12,181 observations in the cleaned dataset
Popular\_Baby\_Names. All duplicate rows were removed, the case
structure of string variables such as ethnicity and first\_name are now
consistently lower case, and the names of the categorical ethnicities in
the enthnicity variable are now consistent throughout the dataset. For
example, the abbreviated “asian and paci” is consistently “asian and
pacific islander,” “black non hisp” is consistently “black non
hispanic,” and “white non hisp” is consistently “white non hispanic.”

## Table Demontrating Rank in Popularity of “Olivia”

This table demonstrates the rank in popularity of the name “Olivia” as a
female baby name over time. There are rows for ethnicities and columns
for years, with years demonstrated in temporal order from 2011 to 2016.

``` r
Olivia = Popular_Baby_Names %>%
  filter(first_name == "olivia") %>%
  select(birth_year, ethnicity, rank) %>%
  arrange(birth_year) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "birth_year",
    values_from = "rank")
library(knitr)
kable(Olivia)
```

| ethnicity                  | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 |
| :------------------------- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| asian and pacific islander |    4 |    3 |    3 |    1 |    1 |    1 |
| black non hispanic         |   10 |    8 |    6 |    8 |    4 |    8 |
| hispanic                   |   18 |   22 |   22 |   16 |   16 |   13 |
| white non hispanic         |    2 |    4 |    1 |    1 |    1 |    1 |

## Table Demonstrating Most Popular Male Name

Similar to the table above for the female name “Olivia,” this table
displays the most popular name and count among male children over time,
for each ethnicity from 2011 to 2016.

``` r
Male = Popular_Baby_Names %>%
  filter(
    gender == "male",
    rank == "1") %>%
  select(birth_year, first_name, ethnicity) %>%
  arrange(birth_year) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "birth_year",
    values_from = "first_name")
kable(Male)
```

| ethnicity                  | 2011    | 2012   | 2013   | 2014   | 2015   | 2016   |
| :------------------------- | :------ | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- |
| asian and pacific islander | ethan   | ryan   | jayden | jayden | jayden | ethan  |
| black non hispanic         | jayden  | jayden | ethan  | ethan  | noah   | noah   |
| hispanic                   | jayden  | jayden | jayden | liam   | liam   | liam   |
| white non hispanic         | michael | joseph | david  | joseph | david  | joseph |

## Scatter Plot Demonstrating Name Popularity

``` r
male_white_children = Popular_Baby_Names %>%
  filter(
    gender == "male",
    birth_year == "2016",
    ethnicity == "white non hispanic")
ggplot(male_white_children, aes(x = rank, y = count)) + geom_point()
```
