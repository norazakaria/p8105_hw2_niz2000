# Problem 1

## Read and Clean the Mr. Trash Wheel Sheet

``` r
library(readxl)
Trash_Wheel_Data = read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  select(-x15, -x16, -x17) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls,0)))
```

    ## New names:
    ## * `` -> ...15
    ## * `` -> ...16
    ## * `` -> ...17

The new 2019 version of the Mr. Trash Wheel data was used for cleaning
and analyses. All non-data entries and rows without dumpster-specific
data were omited, the number of sports balls was converted to an integer
variable, and reasonable variable names were used, such as “dumpster,”
“month,” “year,” and
“sports\_balls.”

## Read and Clean Precipitation Data for 2017 and 2018

``` r
Precipitation_2018 = read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 5, skip=1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(Year = 2018)
```

Rows without precipitation data were omitted, and a “year” variable was
added to the 2018 Precipitation
Data.

``` r
Precipitation_2017 = read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 6, skip=1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(Year = 2017)
```

Rows without precipitation data were omitted, and a “year” variable was
added to the 2017 Precipitation
Data.

### Combine Precipitation Datasets

``` r
Precipitation_Data = bind_rows(Precipitation_2018, Precipitation_2017) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    month = as.numeric(month),
    month = month.abb[month])
```

The precipitation datasets were combined, and the month variable was
converted to a character variable. The “clean\_names” tool was used
throughout the data cleaning steps in order to maintain consistency in
variable names and letter case.

## About The Data:

After cleaning the datasets, there are 344 observations in the dataset
“Trash\_Wheel\_Data” and there are 24 observations in the dataset
“Precipitation\_Data,” including both 2017 and 2018 data. In order to
perform this analysis, several key variables for both datasets were
identified. In the Trash\_Wheel\_Data set, we are interested in “year,”
“month,” “dumpster,” and “sports\_balls,” as these are the variables
used in this analysis. However, variables such as “weight\_tons,”
“volume\_cubic\_yards,” and “homes\_powered” are also key variables in
analysing this dataset in general, as they pertain to the purpose of
Mr. Trash Wheel in harnessing the power of nature to clean the
Baltimore harbor. In the Precipitation\_Data set, we are interested in
the key variables “month” and “total” which demonstrate the amount of
precipitation in inches, each month. Of note, the variable “month” is
present in both the Trash\_Wheel\_Data and Precipitation\_Data datasets,
as a numeric variable. For the available data, the total amount of
precipitation in inches was 70.33 for 2018. The median number of sports
balls in a dumpster in 2017 was 8.

# Problem 2

### Cleaning the Data in the “pols-month.csv”

``` r
pols = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>%
  mutate(
    month = as.numeric(month),
    month = month.abb[month],
    prez_gop = recode(prez_gop, `1` = "gop", `2` = "gop", `0` = "dem"), 
    president = prez_gop) %>%
  select (-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

There are 822 observations in the cleaned pols dataset, related to the
number of national politicians who are democratic or republican at any
given time. In the pols dataset the month variable was broken into
“year,” “month,” and “day” integer variables, and the month number was
replaced with the month name (i.e. the name Jan is displayed, in lieu of
the integer 1). A new president variable was created to indicate whether
the president of that year belonged to the democratic (dem) or
republican (gop) party, and the “day” variable was removed.

### Cleaning the Data in the “snp.csv”

``` r
snp = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year")) %>%
  mutate(
    month = as.numeric(month),
    month = month.abb[month]) %>%
  select (starts_with ("year"), everything(), -day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

There are 787 observations in the cleaned snp dataset, related to
Standard & Poor’s stock market index (S\&P), which is often used as a
representative measure of the stock market overall. In the snp dataset,
the month number was replaced with the month name, and arranged
according to “year” and “month” as the leading columns, followed by the
variable “close,” indicating the closing value of the S\&P stock index
on that associated date.

### Tidy the “Unemployment” Data

``` r
unemployment =
  read_csv(file = "./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec, 
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment rate") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year = as.character(year))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

The unemployment dataset demonstrates the percentage of unemployment per
month within a given year. During cleaning, the dataset was switched
from “wide” to “long” format through pivoting, and key variable names
have the same name to ensure they take the same values. For example,
“year” and “month” are character variables across the unemployment,
pols, and snp datasets. There are 816 observations in the unemployment
dataset.

## Join the Datasets “Pols” and “SNP”

``` r
pols_snp = 
  left_join(pols, snp, by = c("year", "month"))
```

There are 822 observations in the joined dataset pols\_snp, joining pols
and snp into one dataset.

## Join the Datasets “Pols\_SNP” and “Unemployment”

``` r
pols_snp_unemployment = 
  left_join(pols_snp, unemployment, by = c("year", "month"))
```

There are 822 observations in the joined dataset
pols\_snp\_unemployment, joining unemployment to the pol\_snp dataset.

## About The Data:

The cleaned pols dataset containes data from 1947 to 2015 with 822
observations and 9 variables. Key variables from this dataset were
“year” and “month,” as these variables were used to join pols to the
snp and then employment datasets. “Prez\_gop” and “prez\_dem” were also
key variables, as they were used to create the new variable “president.”
The cleaned snp dataset contains data ranging from 1950 to 2015, with
787 observations and 3 variables. All three variables “year,” “month,”
and “close,” are key variables, as “year” and “month” were used to join
datasets, and values for “close” can represente measure of the stock
market. The cleaned unemployment dataset contains data ranging from 1948
to 2015 with 816 observations and 9 variables. All three variables,
“year,” “month,” and “unemployment\_rate” are key variables. Again,
the datasets were joined on the key variables “year” and “month” present
in all three datasets, which were cleaned uniformly in order for the
datasets to join successfully. After joining the datasets pols and snp,
the pols\_snp dataset consists of data from years 1947 to 2015 with 822
observations and 10 variables, containing key variables such as “year,”
“month,” “president,” and “close.” After joining the unemployment
dataset with the new pols\_snp dataset, there are 822 observations and
11 variables, spanning the same range of years (1947 to 2015) and
containing the same variables as the pols\_snp dataset, with the
addition of “unemployment\_rate.” The three datasets were joined on
“year” and “month,” with the final dataset containing the widest range
of variables, and spanning from the earliest year in any of the three
original datasets (1947 from pols) to the latest year of all three
(2015).

# Problem 3

## Tidy the Popular\_Baby\_Names Dataset

``` r
Popular_Baby_Names = 
  read_csv(file = "data/Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(
    first_name = childs_first_name,
    birth_year = year_of_birth) %>%
  mutate(
    first_name = str_to_lower(first_name),
    ethnicity = str_to_lower(ethnicity),
    gender = str_to_lower(gender)) %>%
  mutate(
    ethnicity = if_else(ethnicity == "asian and paci", "asian and pacific islander", ethnicity),
    ethnicity = if_else(ethnicity == "black non hisp", "black non hispanic", ethnicity),
    ethnicity = if_else(ethnicity == "white non hisp", "white non hispanic", ethnicity)) %>%
  distinct()
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   `Year of Birth` = col_double(),
    ##   Gender = col_character(),
    ##   Ethnicity = col_character(),
    ##   `Child's First Name` = col_character(),
    ##   Count = col_double(),
    ##   Rank = col_double()
    ## )

There are 12181 observations in the cleaned dataset
Popular\_Baby\_Names. All duplicate rows were removed, the case
structure of string variables such as ethnicity and first\_name are now
consistently lower case, and the names of the categorical ethnicities in
the enthnicity variable are now consistent throughout the dataset. For
example, the abbreviated “asian and paci” is now consistently “asian and
pacific islander,” “black non hisp” is now consistently “black non
hispanic,” and “white non hisp” is now consistently “white non
hispanic.”

## Table Demontrating Rank in Popularity of “Olivia”

This table demonstrates the rank in popularity of the name “Olivia” as a
female baby name over time. There are rows for ethnicities and columns
for years, with years demonstrated in temporal order from 2011 to 2016.

``` r
Olivia = Popular_Baby_Names %>%
  filter(first_name == "olivia") %>%
  select(birth_year, ethnicity, rank) %>%
  arrange(birth_year) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "birth_year",
    values_from = "rank")
library(knitr)
kable(Olivia)
```

| ethnicity                  | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 |
| :------------------------- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| asian and pacific islander |    4 |    3 |    3 |    1 |    1 |    1 |
| black non hispanic         |   10 |    8 |    6 |    8 |    4 |    8 |
| hispanic                   |   18 |   22 |   22 |   16 |   16 |   13 |
| white non hispanic         |    2 |    4 |    1 |    1 |    1 |    1 |

## Table Demonstrating Most Popular Male Name

Similar to the table above for the female name “Olivia,” this table
displays the most popular name and count among male children over time,
for each ethnicity from 2011 to 2016.

``` r
Male = Popular_Baby_Names %>%
  filter(
    gender == "male",
    rank == "1") %>%
  select(birth_year, first_name, ethnicity) %>%
  arrange(birth_year) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "birth_year",
    values_from = "first_name")
kable(Male)
```

| ethnicity                  | 2011    | 2012   | 2013   | 2014   | 2015   | 2016   |
| :------------------------- | :------ | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- |
| asian and pacific islander | ethan   | ryan   | jayden | jayden | jayden | ethan  |
| black non hispanic         | jayden  | jayden | ethan  | ethan  | noah   | noah   |
| hispanic                   | jayden  | jayden | jayden | liam   | liam   | liam   |
| white non hispanic         | michael | joseph | david  | joseph | david  | joseph |

## Scatter Plot Demonstrating Name Popularity

``` r
male_white_children = Popular_Baby_Names %>%
  filter(
    gender == "male",
    birth_year == "2016",
    ethnicity == "white non hispanic")
ggplot(male_white_children, aes(x = rank, y = count)) + geom_point()
```
